Assignment
Implement a React component that allows managing email addresses. The component displays two lists: available recipients and selected recipients.


Use cases
As a user, I can:

•See the list of all available recipients. A recipient is either an email or a group of emails sharing the same company domain
•Select an individual recipient or a company domain. When a company domain is selected, all emails with the domain are added to the selected recipients’ list
•Enter the name of a company into the autocomplete and select a recipient from the available suggestions
•Enter any email in the autocomplete. If the email passes validation it is possible to add it to the list of available recipients
•See the list of the selected recipients that are grouped into company and email recipients. The groups are expandable and show the contained members
•Remove the recipients from the selected list. It is possible to remove an individual email or all emails sharing a domain at once



The rules
• You must use React and TypeScript to complete this assignment.

• Apart from using React and TypeScript, you are free to implement the component in any way you prefer.

• You may use any external libraries or tools you deem necessary.

• The component should be functional in the latest version of Chrome.
